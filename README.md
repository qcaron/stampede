# stampede
This project uses GPL License v3: it is voluntarily intended to remain a free open-source software to help both defense and prosecution teams in filing evidences during trial.

This project was initiated based on inputs from a defense team member working at ICC - CPI based in The Hague but it will hopefully be useful in other court rooms.

Stampede name is inspired from Vash The Stampede â€” Trigun. Wherever he goes, Vash only leaves ruins behind him. He has a price put on his head but it is not his will to make all that trouble... Even if Vash seems to be guilty, he should have the right for a fair trial. And so is anyone who is subject to trial.
